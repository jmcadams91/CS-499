    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
    
    <p>
        Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has been an evolutionary experience. My time spent at SNHU has sharpened my technical skills, clarified my professional goals, and reinforced
        my commitment to building secure, maintainable, and ethically responsible software. Although this portfolio may not completely reflect all my work throughout the program, it demonstrates my technical growth, 
        calculated mindset, and collaborative spirit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Throughout the program, I’ve cultivated a strong foundation in front end and backend architecture, data modeling, and secure API development. My coursework challenged me to think modularly, troubleshoot
        iteratively, and document with clarity, and these are skills that are now embedded in my daily workflow. For example, in my capstone project, I restored architectural integrity by resolving Git branching issues
        and rebuilding missing folders, ensuring traceability. These experiences taught me to treat every technical challenge as an opportunity for learning and refinement.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve also applied these skills in real world settings outside of school. At Unum, I have collaborated across teams to advocate for quality, low risk delivery, and am undergoing active mentorship with one of our
        senior developers. I have crafted clear and professional communications, applying my analytical background to bridge gaps between stakeholders and development teams. The ability to translate technical decisions
        into business value has become a core part of my professional identity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The program has helped me develop strengths in several key areas:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration in a Team Environment:</strong> I thrive in cross functional settings, where empathy, clarity, and shared ownership drive results. Whether it’s restoring backend logic or mapping out use
        cases, every task is approached with driven precision and a collaborative problem solving mindset.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication with Stakeholders:</strong> I have developed a communication style that balances technical details with emotional intelligence. I’m able to express nuanced appreciation, document complex
        systems, and advocate for maintainable solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong> I’ve implemented search, sort, and filtering logic in real world applications, optimizing performance while maintaining readability. My work in tripUtils.js
        and related modules demonstrates my ability to balance algorithmic efficiency with practical usability.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Engineering and Databases:</strong> I have built secure, scalable systems using Express, MongoDB, TypeScript, and C#. Normalized schemas, integrated middleware, and designed seed logic that
        support reproducibility and reviewer empathy. These backend enhancements reflect a deep understanding of maintainability and modularity.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> I’ve prioritized security at every layer, from bcrypt based password hashing to validation middleware and privacy aware architecture. I’ve also explored emerging trends like
        homomorphic encryption and federated learning, aligning my work with ethical development principles.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        My portfolio artifacts are intentionally structured to reflect this. Each category—Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases—shows a progression from initial enhancement to
        final polish. Together, they demonstrate my ability to build robust systems, optimize logic, and document with clarity. These artifacts are not just technical deliverables; they also represent my growth, values,
        and readiness to contribute meaningfully to the field.
